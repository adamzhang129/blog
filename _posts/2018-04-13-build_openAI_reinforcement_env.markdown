### Brief Intro

OpenAI offer a environment **gym** for reinforcement learning research. Lately, they anounced 8 new playgrounds for robotic manipulation task learning.
Details in publication at https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.09464.pdf . Before seeing this, I turned to ROS+Gazebo for doing manipulation simulation tasks,
which is not the integratable compared to the env offered by **gym**.

However, the **mujoco_py** from OpenAI is not working out of the box. I encountered errors during the installation.
So from here on, I will post problems I ran into and the solution I found.


### System and environment

> * ubuntu 16.04
> * python 3.5 (local env)
> * MUJOCO 150
> * mujoco_py 1.5 latest version


### Get MUJOCO set up
Download mjpro150 on https://www.roboti.us/index.html and also get your licence on https://www.roboti.us/license.html .
Be aware of that one license can be used for multiple version mujoco. MUJOCO provide student license for 1 year trial, use institute 
mail to register.

After downloading, uzip it to **~/.mujoco/mjp150** and move the downloaded key file (usually named **mjkey.txt**) to 
**~/.mujoco/mjp150/bin** & **~/.mujoco** and then run sample code in **bin**directory.

Then run in terminal:

> `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/adam/.mujoco/mjpro150/bin
>   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/lib/nvidia-390
> `

or put then in ~/.bashrc

### Install mujoco_py

Download from https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py and the install using

`sudo pip3 install --no-cache-dir -e .
echo "export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libGLEW.so:/usr/lib/nvidia-390/libGL.so" >> ~/.bashrc`


this installation code can solve **GLEW initalization error: Missing GL version** error when importing.
another workaround I saw is to reduce you version of mujoco_py 1.3 and cooreponding gym MUJOCO version need to be 
adjusted.


BTW you need to 
`sudo apt-get install libglew-dev libglfw-dev`

before importing, otherwise you won't pass compiling.

by now you can run 

`env.render()`

in your code or you can test with mujoco_py/examples.
